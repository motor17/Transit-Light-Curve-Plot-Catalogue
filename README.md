The data is fetched from the Transiting Exoplanet Survery Satellite(TESS) mission's database on the Miulski Archive for Space Telescopes(MAST) website. As of now, I am tinkering with the light curves of exoplanet transits that are subject of the observations of the Wide Angle Search for Planets(WASP) mission.
